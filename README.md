## What is Web Scraping?
Web scraping is a technique used to extract data from websites. It involves automatically fetching web pages, parsing the HTML or XML content, and extracting the desired information. With web scraping, you can gather data from various sources and use it for analysis, research, or other purposes.

## Data Usage and Research
The data obtained from web scraping should be used responsibly and ethically. It is important to respect the terms of service of the websites you scrape and to use the data only for research, analysis, or personal use.
